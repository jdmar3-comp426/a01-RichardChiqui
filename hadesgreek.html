            <p>Greek God of the underworld. While many see him as a bad guy he is just the god of the dead.
                Not the god of death. Therefore he is more of a caretaker for the dead. If we think about him like this
                , we should thank him for looking after all our dead relatives.

                There was a story where he married some girl and because of that the seasons were created. Also a cool sidenote
                is that my gamertag on PSN is Hades aswell. This is my favorite Greek God!
